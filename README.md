# clj-obt-service

Since [clj-obt](https://github.com/ogrim/clj-obt) only support [the Oslo-Bergen-Tagger](https://github.com/noklesta/The-Oslo-Bergen-Tagger) on the Linux platform, this is a simple web service to expose the functionality through text or json calls. Access to a functional installation of the Oslo-Bergen-Tagger is a requirement, follow the directions to install it from here: <https://github.com/noklesta/The-Oslo-Bergen-Tagger>


## Setup

You host the server directly from Leiningen:

	lein run 8085 /home/ogrim/bin/The-Oslo-Bergen-Tagger

Or you can use the standalone jar, requiring only Java:

	java -jar clj-obt-service-0.0.2-standalone.jar 8085 /home/ogrim/bin/The-Oslo-Bergen-Tagger

You will of course supply your own port number and path to the Oslo-Bergen-Tagger. It's recommended to use one of these methods in combination with GNU Screen, or similar.

## Usage

You can get the tagged text as plain text or json.

	http://localhost:8085/text?data=Dette skal tagges.

	http://localhost:8085/json?data=Dette skal tagges.


Tagging of multiple texts at once is also supported. This can sometimes help speed up the tagging process.

	http://localhost:8085/text?data=["Tag denne teksten." "Dette skal og tagges."]

	http://localhost:8085/json?data=["Tag denne teksten." "Dette skal og tagges."]


You will probably have to use some URL encoding on the texts to be tagged, as well as specify ISO-8859-1 as the encoding format on the returned text if you get into trouble with character encoding.
